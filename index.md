I am a Computer Science MS student at IIIT-Hyderabad. I am advised by [Prof. C. V. Jawahar](http://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/) and [Dr. Vineeth N. Balasubramanian](https://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/).

My primary research area is computer vision with my research focus in scene understanding. My current work is on improving smart data annotation through active learning methods for semantic segmentation.
