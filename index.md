I am a Computer Science MS student at IIIT-Hyderabad. I am advised by [Prof. C. V. Jawahar](http://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/) and [Dr. Vineeth N. Balasubramanian](https://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/).

My primary research area is computer vision with my research focus in scene understanding. My current work is on improving smart data annotation through active learning methods for semantic segmentation.

    <p>We present a neural architecture that takes as input a 2D or 3D shape and outputs a program that generates the shape. The instructions in our program are based on constructive solid geometry principles, i.e., a set of boolean operations on shape primitives defined recursively. Bottom-up techniques for this shape parsing task rely on primitive detection and are inherently slow since the search space over possible primitive combinations is large. In contrast, our model uses a recurrent neural network that parses the input shape in a top-down manner, which is significantly faster and yields a compact and easy-to-interpret sequence of modeling instructions. Our model is also more effective as a shape detector compared to existing state-of-the-art detection techniques. We finally demonstrate that our network can be trained on novel datasets without ground-truth program annotations through policy gradient techniques.</p>
