I am a Computer Science MS student at IIIT-Hyderabad. I am advised by [Prof. C. V. Jawahar](http://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/) and [Dr. Vineeth N. Balasubramanian](https://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/).

My primary research area is computer vision with my research focus in scene understanding. My current work is on improving smart data annotation through active learning methods for semantic segmentation.

<p>The ability to capture stabilized high resolution video from low-cost UAVs has the potential to significantly redefine future objectives in the development of state-of-the-art object tracking methods. In this paper, we propose a persistent, robust and autonomous object tracking system designed for UAV applications, called Persistent Aerial Tracking (PAT) (see Fig. 1). Persistent aerial tracking can serve many purposes, not only related to surveillance but also search and rescue, wild-life monitoring, crowd monitoring/management, and extreme sports. Deploying PAT on UAVs is a very promising application, since the camera can follow the target based on its visual feedback and actively change its orientation and position to optimize for tracking performance (e.g. persistent tracking accuracy in the presence of occlusion or fast motion across large and diverse areas). This is the defining difference with static tracking systems, which passively analyze a dynamic scene to produce analytics for other systems. It enables ad-hoc and low-cost surveillance that can be quickly deployed, especially in locales where surveillance infrastructure is not already established or feasible (e.g. remote locations, rugged terrain, and large water bodies.</p>
